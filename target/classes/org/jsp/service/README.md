# Service Package

The Service package contains the business logic of the application. It serves as an intermediary between the DAO layer and the controllers, processing data received from the DAO and returning it to the controllers or other services. This package is responsible for implementing the core functionalities of the application, coordinating between different DAOs, and ensuring that the business rules are applied consistently.
