# Config Package

The Config package is responsible for setting up the application's configuration, including the Inversion of Control (IOC) container and Beans configuration. This package manages environment-specific settings and initializes the necessary components and services required by the application, such as the DataSource, JPA properties, and transaction management. It plays a key role in ensuring that the application is properly configured and ready to run.
