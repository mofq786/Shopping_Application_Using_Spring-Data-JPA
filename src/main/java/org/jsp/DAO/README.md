# DAO Package

The DAO (Data Access Object) package is responsible for managing all database operations in the application. It acts as an abstraction layer between the business logic and the database, ensuring that the application is decoupled from the underlying database implementation. This package handles tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database, as well as executing custom queries and managing transactions.
