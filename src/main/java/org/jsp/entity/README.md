# Entity Package

The Entity package contains the classes that map directly to the tables in the database. Each entity class represents a specific table, and its fields correspond to the columns of that table. This package is crucial for defining the structure of the data stored in the database and establishing relationships between different tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations.
